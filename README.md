Welcome to my GitHub page! I have included some work examples and I hope looking through it is interesting!

[Iowa Baseball](https://github.com/psirena/psirena.github.io/tree/main/IowaBaseball)

I have included some code from my time as a data analyst for Iowa Baseball. The two projects I am most proud of are a swing decision metric and plate appearance simulations. You can find my blog post on swing decisions [here](https://medium.com/iowabaseballmanagers/quantifying-swing-decisions-sds-d59ccb84d820), and a post on the simulations will be published very soon.

[BaseballCloud](https://github.com/psirena/psirena.github.io/tree/main/BaseballCloud)

I had the opportunity to intern with BaseballCloud in the summer of 2020. I helped with modeling and applied this to MLB and college data for two blog posts (viewable [here](https://baseballcloud.blog/author/psirena/)).

[NFL Next Gen Stats](https://github.com/psirena/psirena.github.io/tree/main/NFL_ReceivingProjections)

For a class project, I chose to use [NFL Next Gen Stats](https://nextgenstats.nfl.com/stats/receiving#yards) data to predict receiving yards for wide receivers and tight ends. A copy of the final presentation can be viewed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SnYPYjUtrzVrUu0L_LPzFBq_QWRC55xD/view?usp=sharing).
