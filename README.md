Welcome to my GitHub page! I have included some work examples and I hope looking through it is interesting!

# [Iowa Baseball](https://github.com/psirena/psirena.github.io/tree/main/IowaBaseball)

I have included some code from my time as a data analyst for Iowa Baseball. The two projects I am most proud of are a swing decision metric and plate appearance simulations. You can find my blog post on swing decisions [here](https://medium.com/iowabaseballmanagers/quantifying-swing-decisions-sds-d59ccb84d820), and a post on the simulations will be published very soon.

# [BaseballCloud](https://github.com/psirena/psirena.github.io/tree/main/BaseballCloud)

I had the opportunity to intern with BaseballCloud in the summer of 2020. I helped with modeling and applied this to MLB and college data for two blog posts (viewable [here](https://baseballcloud.blog/author/psirena/)).

# [MLB Defensive Alignments](https://github.com/psirena/psirena.github.io/tree/main/MLB%20Defense)

Defensive alignments are a very interesting topic with the increase in shifts. With this in mind, I created clusters to show where specific hitters tend to hit the ball most often and where they have the best hit probability. Code and the presentation are available for download, or you can view the presentation [here](https://iowa-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/psirena_uiowa_edu/EaKLhuMxHyNFizJElNHyFoMBvw39SfVWKkCs3kExMM1WsQ?e=Gac8TE).

# [NFL Next Gen Stats](https://github.com/psirena/psirena.github.io/tree/main/NFL_ReceivingProjections)

For a class project, I chose to use [NFL Next Gen Stats](https://nextgenstats.nfl.com/stats/receiving#yards) data to predict receiving yards for wide receivers and tight ends. A copy of the final presentation can be viewed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SnYPYjUtrzVrUu0L_LPzFBq_QWRC55xD/view?usp=sharing).

# [Star Wars Action Figure Analysis](https://github.com/psirena/psirena.github.io/tree/main/StarWars)

I have always loved Star Wars and I have over 400 action figures to show it! I recently completed this project to combine my passion for Star Wars with my knowledge of Python.

# [March Madness Predictions](https://github.com/psirena/psirena.github.io/tree/main/MarchMadness)

March Madness has always been interesting to me. Using data science skills to predict the tournament field and outcome of games was a very interesting project. There is no code available since this was completed in Orange, but a copy of the presentation is available for download. We correctly predicted 36 of 38 at-large teams and had Gonzaga vs. Baylor in the final.
