Welcome to my GitHub page! I have included some work examples and I hope looking through it is interesting!

[Iowa Baseball](https://github.com/psirena/psirena.github.io/tree/main/IowaBaseball)

I have included some code from my time as a data analyst for Iowa Baseball. The two projects I am most proud of are a swing decision metric and plate appearance simulations. You can find my blog post on swing decisions [here](https://medium.com/iowabaseballmanagers/quantifying-swing-decisions-sds-d59ccb84d820).
